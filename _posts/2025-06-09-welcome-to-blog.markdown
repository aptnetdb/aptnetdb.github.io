I'm in the process of revamping some of my previous projects as part of my ongoing learning journey.
These projects cover a range of areas that I'm passionate about, and will help refine my skills and explore new ideas.

Currently, my focus is on three key research areas that drive me: healthcare, energy, and the financial sector.
I believe each of these fields will present unique challenges, and I'm open to share my thoughts, findings and collaborate in learning, researching, etc. 

Feel free to check back in for updates, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any thoughts, quesitons, or feedbacks.
