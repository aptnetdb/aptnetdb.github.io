I'm in the process of revamping some of my previous projects as part of my ongoing learning journey.
These projects cover a range of areas that I'm passionate about, and will help refine my skills and explore new ideas.

Currently, my focus is on 2 key areas that drive me: software security and web applications development.
I'm open to share my thoughts, findings and collaborate in learning, researching, etc. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any thoughts, quesitons, feedbacks, or collaborations.
